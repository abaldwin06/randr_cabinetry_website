## Notes from Matt
- For services there is - Installation: We install new pre-made cabinets. If you already have
cabinets purchased from a different company and are just looking to have them installed in
your house, then we can take care of that for you. Custom Cabinets: We can make custom
cabinets that rival any in the business. Having trouble finding the right cabinets to fit your
space? We can make any cabinets to fit in any space needed. Refacing: If you donâ€™t want to
get rid of your old cabinets and go through a whole kitchen remodel, but you still want the
look of new cabinets, we offer cabinet refacing. Cabinet refacing is where we remove all the
old doors and drawers and replace them with new ones that the homeowner picks out. Then
we veneer the cabinet boxes to match the new doors and drawers. Replace: If you want to
get rid of your old cabinets, we can remove them and replace them with new cabinets of
your choice. Custom Woodworking: We also offer custom woodworking for any other job
you have around the house that might need remodeling - mantles, posts, beams, tables, trim
work, shelving, etc...
- For contact page, include service area: metro denver, wheat ridge, arvada, golden, lakewood. email or phone works great. I offer free estimates.
